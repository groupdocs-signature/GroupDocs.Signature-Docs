[**GroupDocs.Signature**](https://products.groupdocs.com/signature/net) provides an easy and straightforward way to find all Barcode signatures that are present in a document.  
For the most simpler use case - just find all Barcode signatures within document¬†its only needed to instantiate¬†[BarcodeSearchOptions](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/net/groupdocs.signature.options/barcodesearchoptions)¬†class and pass it to¬†[Search](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/net/groupdocs.signature/signature/search)¬†method.

Here are the exact steps to search for Barcode signatures within the document with GroupDocs.Signature:

* Create new instance of¬†[Signature](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/net/groupdocs.signature/signature)¬†class and pass source document path as a constructor parameter.
* Instantiate the¬†[BarcodeSearchOptions](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/net/groupdocs.signature.options/barcodesearchoptions)¬†object according to your requirements and specify search options
* Call¬†[Search](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/net/groupdocs.signature/signature/search)¬†method of¬†[Signature](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/net/groupdocs.signature/signature)¬†class instance and pass¬†[BarcodeSearchOptions](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/net/groupdocs.signature.options/barcodesearchoptions)¬†to it.

This example shows how to search for Barcode signature in the document.

```csharp
using (Signature signature = new Signature("sample.pdf"))
{
        // search for signatures in document
        List<BarcodeSignature> signatures = signature.Search<BarcodeSignature>(SignatureType.Barcode);

        Console.WriteLine("\nSource document contains following signatures.");
        foreach (var barcodeSignature in signatures)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Barcode signature found at page {0} with type {1} and text {2}",
                barcodeSignature.PageNumber, barcodeSignature.EncodeType, barcodeSignature.Text);
        }
}
```
