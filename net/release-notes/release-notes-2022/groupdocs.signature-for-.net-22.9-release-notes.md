## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

#### Public classÂ [SMS](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/net/groupdocs.signature.domain.extensions/sms) was added to provide SMS QR Code object properties

Class [SMS] contains following properties to get or set.

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Represents SMS short message service details.
/// </summary>
public class SMS
{
    /// <summary>
    ///Gets or sets SMS receipient phone number.
    /// </summary>
    public string Number { get; set; }

    /// <summary>
    ///Gets or sets SMS message content.
    /// </summary>
    public string Message { get; set; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Creates VCard instance with default values.
    /// </summary>
    public SMS()
    {
    }
}
```

The following example demonstrates how to create SMS QR Code standard entry.

**Create QR Code signature with SMS**

```csharp
public static void Run()
{
    using (Signature signature = new Signature("sample.pdf"))
    {
        // create SMS object
        SMS sms = new SMS()
        {
            Number = "0800 048 0408",
            Message = "Document approval automatic SMS message"
        };
        // create options
        QrCodeSignOptions options = new QrCodeSignOptions
        {
            EncodeType = QrCodeTypes.QR,
            // setup Data property to SMS instance
            Data = sms,
            // set right bottom corner
            HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Left,
            VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignment.Center,
            Width = 100,
            Height = 100,
            Margin = new Padding(10)
        };

        // sign document to file
        signature.Sign(outputFilePath, options);
        Console.WriteLine($"\nSource document signed successfully with {signResult.Succeeded.Count} signature(s).\nFile saved at {outputFilePath}.");
    }
} 
```
