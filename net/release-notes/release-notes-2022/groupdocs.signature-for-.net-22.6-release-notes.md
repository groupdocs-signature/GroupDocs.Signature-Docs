Below the list of most notable changes in release of GroupDocs.Signature for .NET 21.6:

* Implemented ability to specify the order of signature for Spreadsheet, Word process and Image documents.
* Provided full SVG file type support for image documents and most signature types.
* Involved a significant optimization of file detection algorithm.
* Implement adjustment on image preview signature for front-end applications.
* Fixed a few internal issues.
* Update the referenced libraries to the latest versions.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

#### New public enumeration [WiFiEncryptionType](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/net/groupdocs.signature.domain.extensions/wifiencryptiontype) was added to specify various encryption types for the WiFi QR Code entities

This enumeration keeps supported WiFi encryption types.

**New public enumeration**

```csharp
    /// <summary>
    /// Represents WiFi Encryption type.
    /// </summary>
    [Obfuscation(Feature = "internalization", Exclude = true, ApplyToMembers = true)]
    [Flags]
    public enum WiFiEncryptionType
    {
        /// <summary>Represents no encryption WiFi type.</summary>
        None = 0,

        /// <summary>Represents WiFi with the WPA encryption type.</summary>
        WPA = 1,

        /// <summary>Represents WiFi with the WPA-EAP encryption type.</summary>
        WPAEAP = 2,

        /// <summary>Represents WiFi with the WPA/WPA2 encryption type.</summary>
        WPAWPA2 = 3,

        /// <summary>Represents WiFi with the WEP encryption type.</summary>
        WEP = 4,
    }
```

#### Public classÂ [WiFi](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/net/groupdocs.signature.domain.extensions/wifi) was added to provide WiFi QR Code object properties

Class [WiFi] contains following properties to get or set.

The following example demonstrates how to create WiFi QR Code standard entry.

**Create QR Code signature with WiFi**

```csharp
public static void Run()
{
    using (Signature signature = new Signature(filePath))
    {
        // create WiFi object
        WiFi wifi  = new WiFi()
        {
            SSID = "GuestNetwork!",
            Encryption = WiFiEncryptionType.WPAWPA2,
            Password = "guest",
            Hidden = false
        };
        // create options
        QrCodeSignOptions options = new QrCodeSignOptions
        {
            EncodeType = QrCodeTypes.QR,
            // setup Data property to SMS instance
            Data = wifi,
            // set right bottom corner
            HorizontalAlignment = HorizontalAlignment.Left,
            VerticalAlignment = VerticalAlignment.Center,
            Width = 100,
            Height = 100,
            Margin = new Padding(10)
        };

        // sign document to file
        signature.Sign(outputFilePath, options);
        Console.WriteLine($"\nSource document signed successfully with {signResult.Succeeded.Count} signature(s).\nFile saved at {outputFilePath}.");
    }
} 
```
