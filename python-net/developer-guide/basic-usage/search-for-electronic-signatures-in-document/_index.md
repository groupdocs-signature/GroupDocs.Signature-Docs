Electronically signed documents can be searched for specific signatures for different purposes, such as signature properties review, verification, and analysis.

[**GroupDocs.Signature for Python via .NET**](https://products.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net) API allows you to search signatures within documents based on various search filters and returns a list of electronic signatures that match the search criteria.

Here's a basic example of how to search for signatures in a document using Python:

```python
import groupdocs.signature as signature
from groupdocs.signature.options import TextSearchOptions

# Initialize signature
with signature.Signature("sample.pdf") as sign:
    # Create search options
    search_options = TextSearchOptions()
    
    # Search for signatures
    result = sign.search(search_options)
    
    # Process found signatures
    for text_signature in result:
        print(f"Found text signature: {text_signature.text}")
        print(f"Page number: {text_signature.page_number}")
        print(f"Position: X={text_signature.left}, Y={text_signature.top}")
```
