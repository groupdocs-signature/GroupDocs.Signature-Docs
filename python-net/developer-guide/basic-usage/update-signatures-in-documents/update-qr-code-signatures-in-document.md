[**GroupDocs.Signature for Python via .NET**](https://products.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net) provides functionality to manipulate QR code signatures' location, size, encode type, and textual content.
Please note that the [update](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/groupdocs.signature/signature/update/) method modifies the same document that was passed to the constructor of the [Signature](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/groupdocs.signature/signature) class.

Here are the steps to update a QR code signature in a document with GroupDocs.Signature:

* Create a new instance of the [Signature](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/groupdocs.signature/signature) class and pass the source document path as a constructor parameter
* Instantiate the [QrCodeSearchOptions](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/groupdocs.signature.options/qrcodesearchoptions) object with desired properties
* Call the [search](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/groupdocs.signature/signature/search) method to obtain a list of QR code signatures
* Select from the list the [QrCodeSignature](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/groupdocs.signature.domain/qrcodesignature) object(s) that should be updated
* Call the [Signature](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/groupdocs.signature/signature) object's [update](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/groupdocs.signature/signature/update/) method and pass one or several signatures to it

This example shows how to update a QR code signature that was found using the [search](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/groupdocs.signature/signature/search) method:

```python
import groupdocs.signature as signature
from groupdocs.signature.options import QrCodeSearchOptions

# Initialize signature
with signature.Signature("signed.pdf") as sign:
    # Create search options
    options = QrCodeSearchOptions()
    
    # Search for QR code signatures in document
    signatures = sign.search(options)
    
    if len(signatures) > 0:
        # Get first QR code signature
        qr_code_signature = signatures[0]
        
        # Change position
        qr_code_signature.left = 100
        qr_code_signature.top = 100
        
        # Update the signature
        result = sign.update(qr_code_signature)
        
        if result.updated_count > 0:
            print(f"Signature with QR code '{qr_code_signature.text}' was updated in the document")
        else:
            print("Signature was not updated in the document!")
```
