## Free Trial or Temporary License

You can try GroupDocs.Signature without purchasing a license.

### Free Trial

The evaluation version is identical to the full version â€” it simply becomes fully licensed when you apply a license. Instructions for setting a license are provided in the following sections.

The evaluation version has the following limitations:
* Only the first three pages are processed.
* Documents with more than three pages are not supported.
* A trial watermark is placed at the top of each page.

### Temporary License

If you'd like to test GroupDocs.Signature without the limitations of the trial version, you can request a 30-day Temporary License. For more information, see the [Get a Temporary License](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license) page.

## How to Set Up a License

{{< alert style="info" >}}
For information on pricing, visit the [Pricing Information](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/pricing/) page.
{{< /alert >}}

Once youâ€™ve obtained a license, follow these instructions to set it up. 

A license should be set:
- Only once per application, and
- Before using any other GroupDocs.Signature classes.

{{< alert style="tip" >}}
Though the license can be set multiple times per application, it is recommended to set it only once, as repeated calls to the `set_license` method will use unnecessary processing time.
{{< /alert >}}

### Set Environment Variable

You can set the `GROUPDOCS_LIC_PATH` environment variable to the absolute path of the license file. GroupDocs.Signature will then read this value and apply the license.

{{< tabs "set-license-env-var">}}
{{< tab "Windows (Command Prompt)" >}}
```ps
set GROUPDOCS_LIC_PATH "C:\path\to\your\license\file.lic"
```
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Windows (Powershell)" >}}
```ps
$env:GROUPDOCS_LIC_PATH="C:\path\to\your\license\file.lic"
```
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "macOS" >}}
```bash
export GROUPDOCS_LIC_PATH="/path/to/your/license/file.lic"
```
{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

### Copy License into Project Root Folder

GroupDocs.Signature can also read a license from the projectâ€™s root directory. Consider a simple Python app structure:

```Directory
ðŸ“‚ my-app
 â”œâ”€â”€app.py
 â”œâ”€â”€source.docx
 â”œâ”€â”€groupdocs_signature_net-25.4-py3-none-*.whl
 â””â”€â”€GroupDocs.Signature.PythonViaNET.lic
```

When you run the application from the `my-app` folder, GroupDocs.Signature will check for files with a `.lic` extension in this folder. It will read the `GroupDocs.Signature.PythonViaNET.lic` file to apply the license.

### Set License from a File

The following code demonstrates setting a license from a file:

```python
import os
from groupdocs.signature import License

def set_license_from_file():
    # Get absolution path to license file
    license_path = os.path.abspath("./GroupDocs.Signature.PythonViaNET.lic")

    # Instantiate License and set the license
    license = License()
    license.set_license(license_path)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    set_license_from_file()
```

### Set License from a Stream

This example shows how to set a license from a stream:

```python
import os
from groupdocs.signature import License

def set_license_from_stream():
    # Get absolution path to license file
    license_path = os.path.abspath("./GroupDocs.Signature.PythonViaNET.lic")

    # Create a readable steam
    with open(license_path, "rb") as license_stream:
        # Instantiate License and set the license
        # Instantiate License and set the license
        license = License()
        license.set_license(license_stream)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    set_license_from_stream()
```

### Set Metered License

A [Metered License](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/python-net/groupdocs.signature/metered) is also available as an alternative to a traditional license file. It is a usage-based licensing model that may be more suitable for customers who prefer to be billed based on actual API feature usage. For more information, refer to the [Metered Licensing FAQ](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/faqs/licensing/metered).

The following sample demonstrates how to use metered licensing:

```python
from groupdocs.signature import Metered

def set_metered_license():
    # Set your public and private keys
    public_key = "******" 
    private_key = "******" 

    # Instantiate Metered and set keys
    metered = Metered()
    metered.set_metered_key(public_key, private_key)

    # Get a number of MBs processed 
    mb_processed = metered.get_consumption_quantity()
    print("MB processed: ", mb_processed)

    # Get a number of credits used
    credits_used = metered.get_consumption_credit()
    print("Credits used: ", credits_used)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    set_metered_license()
```
