## Overview
[**GroupDocs.Signature**](https://products.groupdocs.com/signature/nodejs-java) provides [BarcodeSignature](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/nodejs-java/com.groupdocs.signature.domain/barcodesignature) class to manipulate barcode signatures and delete them from the documents over [Delete](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/nodejs-java/com.groupdocs.signature/signature/delete) method.  
Please be aware that [Delete](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/nodejs-java/com.groupdocs.signature/signature/delete) method modifies the same document that was passed to constructor of [Signature](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/nodejs-java/com.groupdocs.signature/signature) class.

## How to delete Barcode signature from the document
Here are the steps to delete Barcode signature from the document with GroupDocs.Signature:

* Create new instance of [Signature](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/nodejs-java/com.groupdocs.signature/signature) class and pass source document path as a constructor parameter;
* Instantiate [BarcodeSearchOptions](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/nodejs-java/com.groupdocs.signature.options.search/barcodesearchoptions/) object with desired properties;
* Call [Search](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/nodejs-java/com.groupdocs.signature/signature/#search(com.groupdocs.signature.options.search.SearchOptions)) method to obtain list of [BarcodeSignature](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/nodejs-java/com.groupdocs.signature.domain/barcodesignature);
* Select from list [BarcodeSignature](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/nodejs-java/com.groupdocs.signature.domain/barcodesignature) object(s) that should be removed from the document;
* Call [Signature](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/nodejs-java/com.groupdocs.signature/signature) object [Delete](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/nodejs-java/com.groupdocs.signature/signature/delete) method and pass one or several signatures to it.

This example shows how to delete Barcode signature that was found using [Search](https://reference.groupdocs.com/signature/nodejs-java/com.groupdocs.signature/signature/#search(com.groupdocs.signature.options.search.SearchOptions)) method.

```javascript
  const filePath = Constants.SAMPLE_PDF_SIGNED; 
  const fileName = path.basename(filePath);

  const outputDirectory = path.join(Constants.OutputPath, 'DeleteBarcode');
  if (!fs.existsSync(outputDirectory)) {
    fs.mkdirSync(outputDirectory, { recursive: true });
  }

  // Copy source file since the delete method works with the same Document
  const outputFilePath = path.join(outputDirectory, fileName);

  fs.copyFileSync(filePath, outputFilePath);

  const signature = new signatureLib.Signature(outputFilePath);

  const options = new signatureLib.BarcodeSearchOptions();

  // Search for Barcode signatures in the document
  const signatures =  signature.search(signatureLib.BarcodeSignature.class, options).toArray();
  if (signatures.length > 0) {
     const barcodeSignature = signatures[0];
     const isDeleted = signature.delete(outputFilePath, barcodeSignature);
  
     const barcodeText = barcodeSignature.getText();
     const encodeTypeName = barcodeSignature.getEncodeType().getTypeName();
  
     if (isDeleted) {
         console.log(
             `Signature with Barcode '${barcodeText}' and encode type '${encodeTypeName}' was successfully deleted from the document '${fileName}'.`
         );
     } else {
         console.log(
             `Failed to delete the signature! Barcode '${barcodeText}' with encode type '${encodeTypeName}' was not removed from the document '${fileName}'.`
         );
     }
  }
```
